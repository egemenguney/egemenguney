# 🛡️ Egemen Güney | Cyber Threat Intelligence & DevSecOps Engineer

**Ex-Apple Technical Support Specialist** turned **Advanced Threat Researcher**.  
I build high-performance, autonomous pipelines to track malware from GitHub repositories down to the final payload execution.

### 🏹 The Intelligence Pipeline: ThreatHunter v2.0
My current ecosystem is a fully automated, asynchronous malware analysis factory.

* **⚡ High-Speed Recon:** Built with `httpx` for asynchronous scanning, enabling rapid discovery of malicious repositories at scale.
* **🔬 Deep Payload Tracking:** End-to-end tracking from initial repo discovery to payload extraction and C2 infrastructure mapping.
* **🧠 Intelligent Clustering:** Autonomous clustering of threats based on behavioral patterns and campaign characteristics.
* **🛡️ Verification & De-obfuscation:** * **Cross-Check Engine:** Validates findings across multiple repositories.
    * **Hash-Based Verification:** Identifies and verifies obfuscated JS files through global hash comparisons.
* **🌐 Network & Dynamic Analysis:** * **Selenium Wire:** Real-time network traffic interception and analysis of malware stage-loaders.
    * **Automated Sandboxing:** Direct feeding to VirusTotal for behavioral analysis and automated screenshot capture.

### 🛠️ Technical Arsenal
- **Languages:** Python (Asyncio, Httpx), Bash, YARA.
- **Tools:** Selenium Wire, VirusTotal API, Hybrid Analysis, Docker.
- **Methodologies:** Malware Clustering, Network Traffic Analysis, Heuristic & ML Ensemble Detection.
- **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare Zero Trust, Secure CI/CD Pipelines, Automated Logging.
